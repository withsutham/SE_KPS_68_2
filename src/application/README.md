## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Setup and Running Locally

Follow these steps to get the project running on your machine:

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    First, ensure you have all the required packages installed:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Navigate to the `src/application` directory. You will find a file named `.env.example`. 
    - Copy or rename this file to `.env.local`.
    - Update the following keys with your Supabase details (found in **Project Settings > API**):
    
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    ```
    *(Note: `.env.local` is ignored by git to keep your keys safe, while `.env.example` remains public for the team.)*

3.  **Start the Development Server**
    Run the following command to start the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Verify the Installation**
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
    - To check if the database connection is working, visit [http://localhost:3000/api/getUsers](http://localhost:3000/api/getUsers). You should see a JSON response from the server.
